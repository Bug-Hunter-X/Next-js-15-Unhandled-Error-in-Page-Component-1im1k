# Next.js 15 Unhandled Error in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when an unexpected error is thrown within a page component.  The error is not properly caught, resulting in a less than ideal user experience.

## Problem

When an unhandled error is thrown in a page component, Next.js 15 may not display an appropriate error message or handle the situation gracefully.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling within the page component using try...catch blocks, or utilizing Next.js's built-in error handling mechanisms like `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` to handle errors at the data fetching stage.
